// The Daily question at the top of My community's feed ("Live thread"): one question a day from Rehyn, the same for
// everyone, with the community's answers coming in under it and the person's own answer pinned beneath. Each
// question has a key phrase (underlined on the card), a few starters to begin an answer from, and the answers of the
// example people in My community (as everywhere in this preview, they are examples), some with a tag for the kind of
// answer. The meeting memo suggested taking the first prompt of the day from Krillion (krillion.me); its prompts
// load inside the game and are its own catalogue, so they would need its makers' permission (or a feed from them).
// With one, `dailyQuestion` is the single place to swap in that source.
//
// The questions are for people in recovery talking to others who have been there, not general small talk: each one
// asks about living with recovery (tips, the unseen parts, hard and good days, the people who help, what is coming
// back) and is open, so an answer is a short story or a tip that others can reply to, never a yes, a no or one word.
// The starters are the beginnings of sentences ("Nobody warned me…"), not ready-made answers.
